# BSc-Research-Project

This python program was used for calibrating and analysing spectral profiles of plasma plumes taken from a Carbon (graphite) target with the spectrometer centered at 650nm. It should be noted that the beginning of this code uses a Neon and a Krypton calibration lamp to calibrate the wavelengths (x-axis of final plots) and  QTH lamp to calibrate the relative intensities measured in the spectrometer. For different spectrometers or calibration tools, the calculations of emission peaks will have to be adjusted accordingly.
